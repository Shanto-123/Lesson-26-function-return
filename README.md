# Lesson-26-function-return
The function `add(number_1, number_2)` is designed to take two numbers and return their sum. When you call it with `5` and `10`, it adds these two numbers together, returning `15`. The `print(add(5,10))` line then prints that result, so youâ€™ll see `15` displayed. It's a straightforward way to create a reusable addition function and get the result instantly.
